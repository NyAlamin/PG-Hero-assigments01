            <h1>Heaviest Floods In 122 Years Hit Bangladesh’s </h1>
            
            <p class="p2">
                Monsoon storms and incessant rains have put Bangladesh in the face of devastating floods which led to deaths of at least 32 people.
                More than nine million people are homeless as floodwaters inundate their homes destroying their belongings.
                The Bangladesh Army continues to work with local administrations in evacuating stranded people from several inundated parts of the country and assist in the relief operations.
                Last week, Bangladesh and the northeastern states of India faced incessant rains causing extreme flooding in several parts of both nations.
